# API Mocking for modern Javascript and Typescript applicaitons.

Goals of Kmock
- a chrome extension to help mock live REST APIs
- mock server that connects the dots
- integrations with Mock Server, Mocker API, Mirage JS, and more on the way (WIP)
- write an api 'scenario' and use it locally or in tests.
 - Your scenarios can be used to extract cypress interception compatible code for end to end tests
 - MSW compatible functions can be provided from a scenario
